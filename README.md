# Cab Booking System

## Project Overview

The **Cab Booking System** is designed using a **microservices architecture**, comprising three distinct services:

1. **Cab-Frontend Microservice**:
   - Handles the user interface for booking a cab, displaying the booking form, and processing user input.
   - It communicates with the backend services to handle booking requests and fare calculations.

2. **Cab-Booking Microservice**:
   - Manages the cab booking process, including storing booking details and calculating the fare for the trip.

3. **Fare-Calculation Microservice**:
   - Responsible for calculating the fare based on the source and destination provided by the user.

The frontend interacts with both the **Cab-Booking Microservice** (for booking cabs) and the **Fare-Calculation Microservice** (for fare estimation). The system is built using **Spring Boot** for each of the microservices and communicates through **RESTful APIs**.

## Steps Taken

### 1. **Cab-Frontend Microservice**:
   - **CabBookingController** was implemented to manage user interactions for booking a cab:
     - It handles user input, sends a request to the **Cab-Booking Microservice** to book a cab, and calls the **Fare-Calculation Microservice** to estimate the fare.
     - The controller uses **RestTemplate** to make **POST** and **GET** requests to the backend services and processes their responses.
     - Proper error handling was implemented to provide feedback when the backend services are unavailable or if there is an issue with the booking process.
     - The controller also renders the appropriate views (JSP files) to display the booking information to the user.

### 2. **Cab-Booking Microservice**:
   - **CabBookingController** was implemented to handle the booking functionality:
     - The controller receives booking requests from the frontend, validates the data, and stores the cab booking details.
     - A fare is calculated (typically, this would involve complex business logic, but for simplicity, it's done in this service), and the booking details, along with the fare, are returned to the frontend.
     - The **CabBookingService** manages the core business logic for the cab booking process.
     - Upon success, the booking ID and calculated fare are returned to the frontend, allowing the user to view the details.

### 3. **Fare-Calculation Microservice**:
   - **FareCalculationController** was implemented to handle fare estimation:
     - This service receives the source and destination from the frontend and calculates the fare.
     - A simple fare calculation logic is used, though this could later be extended to incorporate more detailed algorithms or dynamic pricing models (e.g., based on traffic, distance, or time of day).
     - The controller exposes a **GET API**, which is called by the **Cab-Frontend Microservice** to calculate the fare when the user submits the booking form.

## Current State of the Project

- **Cab-Frontend Microservice**:
  - Successfully integrates with the backend services to display the booking form and process bookings.
  - Displays the correct booking ID and fare in the user interface.
  - Error handling is in place for potential failures in communication with backend services.
  
- **Cab-Booking Microservice**:
  - Manages the cab booking process, storing the booking details, and calculating the fare.
  - Returns booking information (ID and fare) upon successful booking.
  
- **Fare-Calculation Microservice**:
  - Handles fare estimation based on source and destination.
  - Returns a calculated fare to the frontend when requested.

- **Testing**:
  - **JUnit** test cases are implemented to validate the core logic in each microservice's controller, ensuring that the system works as expected.
  - Mocking is used in the tests to simulate responses from the backend services, ensuring that the frontend handles different scenarios effectively.

- **Deployment**:
  - Each service is deployed locally and can communicate with each other over HTTP.
  - There are no issues with the integration between the three microservices.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Improve error handling to capture more specific error messages (e.g., network issues, invalid inputs) and provide better feedback to users.
   - Add **global exception handlers** for consistent error responses across all services.

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement **JWT-based authentication** or **OAuth 2.0** for secure communication between services and user authentication.
   - Ensure that the **Cab-Frontend Microservice** implements **CSRF protection** for the forms.

3. **API Documentation**:
   - Add **Swagger** documentation to the REST APIs for easy exploration of the available endpoints.
   - This will help developers and future collaborators to understand and integrate with the system.

4. **More Complex Fare Calculation**:
   - Extend the fare calculation logic to incorporate real-world scenarios such as:
     - Traffic-based pricing.
     - Dynamic pricing based on time, demand, or location.
     - User-specific discounts or promotions.

5. **Test Case Improvements**:
   - Simplify and refactor test cases to reduce complexity.
   - Introduce **integration tests** to simulate the full user journey from frontend to backend.
   - Ensure that test coverage is comprehensive and validates different edge cases (e.g., invalid input, service failures).

6. **User Interface Enhancements**:
   - Improve the user interface with better design and styling (e.g., using **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS**).
   - Provide more detailed user feedback (e.g., loading spinners, success/error alerts).

7. **Containerization & Deployment**:
   - **Dockerize** all three microservices to ensure consistent environments across local development, testing, and production.
   - Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI to automate testing and deployment.
   - Consider deploying the services to a cloud provider like **AWS** or **Heroku** for production use.

8. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - Implement **caching** in the **Fare-Calculation Microservice** to reduce repetitive fare calculations.
   - Implement **load balancing** and **service discovery** (using **Eureka** or **Spring Cloud**).

9. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Integrate **application monitoring tools** like **Prometheus** or **New Relic** to track the performance of the services.
   - Set up **centralized logging** using tools like **ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Splunk** for easy troubleshooting.
